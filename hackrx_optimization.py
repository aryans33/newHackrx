    print("✅ Unknown Documents: 2.0x weight (CRITICAL)")
    print("✅ Complex Questions: Higher weights (up to 2.0x)")
    print("✅ Wrong Answers: 0 points (NO GUESSING)")
    print("✅ Accuracy > Coverage (Better to skip than be wrong)")
    
    print("\n🚀 System Optimizations Needed:")
    print("1. Enhanced confidence scoring")
    print("2. Better 'insufficient information' detection")
    print("3. Robust parsing for unknown document formats")
    print("4. Multi-step reasoning for complex questions")
    print("5. Answer validation and fact-checking")
    
    print("\n📋 Current System Strengths:")
    print("✅ Handles 10/10 questions successfully")
    print("✅ Proper 'insufficient information' responses")
    print("✅ GROQ API with retry logic (reliable)")
    print("✅ HackRX format compliance")
    print("✅ Bearer token authentication")
    
    print("\n⚠️  Areas for Improvement:")
    print("🔧 Add confidence thresholds")
    print("🔧 Implement answer validation")
    print("🔧 Enhance complex question handling")
    print("🔧 Add document type detection")
    print("🔧 Implement fallback strategies")
    
    print("\n🎯 Competition Strategy:")
    print("1. Focus on ACCURACY over speed")
    print("2. Prioritize unknown documents (2x weight)")
    print("3. Identify complex questions (likely higher weight)")
    print("4. Use conservative confidence thresholds")
    print("5. Validate answers against document context")
